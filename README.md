## Projects

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src=""> **[Customer Churn Prediction for Mobile Game Users](https://github.com)** 

Project description
This project develops a pipeline to predict player churn in a mobile game using behavioral log data. I implemented a full end-to-end workflow including data cleaning, feature engineering, OP/CP window–based churn labeling, class-imbalance handling, machine learning modeling (Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression), and SHAP-based model explainability.

The project demonstrates my ability to structure analytical problems, transform raw timestamped user logs into meaningful behavioral features, evaluate models under strong imbalance, and interpret model decisions using explainability tools.

It highlights expertise in Python, pandas, scikit-learn, imbalanced-learn, XGBoost, and SHAP.

Project description

I designed and implemented a multi-agent system to automate sales data analysis and reporting. Each agent had a specific role: data cleaning, statistical analysis using Python (Pandas), insight generation with OpenAI GPT-5 Mini, and visualization with Matplotlib. The system autonomously processed a large retail dataset and generated actionable reports, including seasonal trends, top-performing categories, and potential demand forecasts. This project highlights my experience in integrating AI models, building automated data pipelines, and producing evidence-based insights ready for decision-making.

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src=""> **[Reproducibility](https://github.com)** 
Project description

This portfolio was created for the Reproducibility and Model Deployment course. Across two end-to-end machine learning projects, I practiced using tools such as Git, Makefiles, Docker, Streamlit, and REST APIs to build reproducible pipelines for data scraping, cleaning, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

The projects include implementing deterministic ML workflows, packaging models into APIs, containerizing applications, and managing experiment results. Together, they demonstrate my ability to design practical, structured, and reproducible data science solutions from raw data to deployed models.

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src=""> **[Production Data Analysis](https://github.com)** 
Project description

This project analyzes production data from Spectrum Shades LLC to identify factors contributing to inconsistent concrete pigment quality. The work includes data cleaning, supplier comparison, filtering for quality-critical conditions, and statistical analysis—including correlation—to help improve product reliability and customer satisfaction.

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src=""> **[Grocery Store Sales](https://github.com)** 
Project description

This project analyzes grocery store product data for FoodYum, a U.S.-based retail chain. It includes SQL tasks focused on data cleaning, missing value handling, and exploratory queries to support pricing and inventory decisions. The project demonstrates skills in SQL querying, data validation, and preparing datasets for analysis.

<img align="left" width="250" height="150" src=""> **[Magic Sweeper - Intelligent Vacuum Bot](https://github.com)** 
Project description

Magic Sweeper is an intelligent robot vacuum cleaner I programmed in Python as part of an Programming class at Tilburg University. The goal was to design a bot that navigates an unknown grid-based environment, detects stains, avoids obstacles, saves energy, and cleans the entire map without ever seeing the full layout. My bot uses memory, rule-based navigation, and logic handling for stain detection, zig-zag sweeping, and obstacle avoidance. I was ranked in top 10 in the class for this project, and it showcases my skills in Python programming and algorithm design.
